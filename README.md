## Twearch

This is my attempt at implementing a small app that just searches Twitter
with geolocation support.

## Twitter API Auth

If you'd like to test out this app, you'll need to get some Twitter API OAuth keys/secrets
for both the app and the consumer. No offense, but I'm not feeling like sharing
my OAuth credentials publicly ;)

The credentials go into ```config/twitter.yml```

```yaml
---
:consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY
:consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET
:oauth_token: OAUTH_TOKEN
:oauth_token_secret: OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET

```
